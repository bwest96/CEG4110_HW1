##Usage
To install and run app execute app-release.apk located in the bin directory.
The app requires permission to write to storage.

The app has two different UIs. The first UI is an interface to change the color of a text field. On the button, "Change Color", click the text field text changes color to a random rgb color and text changes to show rgb value and HTML color code. 

The app uses a switch to change between the two UIs.

The second UI is a paint canvas to draw images on. The UI allows the ability to clear and save the canvas. The save funtcion saves the image to the DCIM directory. Also the app has the ability to let you change the color you draw with. Change color uses an UI with 3 seekBars for red, green and blue, with a color previewer that updates when pushed.
